    <div class="container-01" style="font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: .2px;"><strong>Irving Harper</strong>, a designer for George Nelson Associates, created the Marshmallow Sofa 
        as an example of customizable mass-produced design. Each cushion is a barstool seat mounted individually 
        on a metal frame. Cushions could be added or subtracted to manufacture a sofa in any number of lengths. 
        The Marshmallow Sofa was intended to be a modern solution to low-cost furniture production, because 
        upholstering chairs was a time-consuming, hand-done process. Unfortunately the injection-molded plastic 
        seat presentation that inspired the sofa ultimately did not work, leaving the company to make and cover 
        the cushions one at a time. Kirkland Museum’s Marshmallow Sofa is from the original production with foam 
        cushions covered in original orange naugahyde (vinyl coated fabric, expensive in its day). Less than 190 
        were made between 1956 and 1961 due to their intricacy. The Marshmallow Sofa’s bright colors (including 
        mix-and-match cushion colors), unification of separate parts and strong geometric design made it a precursor 
        to the Pop Art designs of the 1960s. Architect and designer Alexander Girard, the head of the fabric and 
        textile division at Herman Miller, designed the hues of the naugahyde upholstery. Though the Marshmallow 
        Sofa was an icon of “atomic” style with its round, modular parts, its producer, the Herman Miller Furniture 
        Company, found practical issues with its design: it was not very stable and would flip over if someone sat 
        at the end of the empty couch. Since the design and manufacturing process were impractical and expensive, 
        and the design was radical for its time, original Marshmallow Sofas have become a rare design icon.</div>
    

    <div class="container-02" style="font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: .2px;">Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen 
        had clear objectives when it came to furniture design: “It must be classic, in the sense of responding to an 
        often recurring need.” One such need emerged in the mid-1950s, while he was designing dining furniture for Knoll. 
        “I wanted to clear up the slum of legs,” he said, speaking of the unsatisfactory undercarriages he observed in the 
        chairs and tables of his day. Saarinen had addressed the problem before. For the Kingswood School for girls at 
        Michigan’s Cranbrook Schools (his father, Eliel, was president of Cranbrook Academy of Art and head of its architecture 
        program), he devised a table with four legs clustered into a central base. But the streamlined, mass-producible concept 
        he 3 presented to Knoll scrapped the legs altogether. Instead, the Pedestal Collection’s star was a tabletop of wood 
        veneer, marble, or plastic set atop a cast-aluminum swoop. Soon after its 1957 introduction, the Pedestal table was 
        everywhere, from modern homes across the nation to commercial interiors. A custom version with marble top, terrazzo base, 
        and functioning fountain was devised for Saarinen’s iconic Miller house in Columbus, Indiana. A fleet with polished bronze 
        tops and black enameled aluminum bases was sent to the Four Seasons restaurant in 1959. Recently, they were sprinkled throughout 
        Saarinen’s 1962 TWA Terminal, reborn as part of the TWA Hotel at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.</div>
