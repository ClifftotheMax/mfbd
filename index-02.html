    <div class="container-01"> In his purist approach to design, Finnish-born Eero Saarinen sought out the essential 
        idea and reduced it to the most effective structural solution. "The underside of typical chairs and tables makes 
        a confusing, unrestful world," explained Saarinen. "I wanted to clear up the slum of legs." In his pedestal collection, 
        which includes a dining, coffee and side table, Saarinen realized his ideal of formal unity: "Every significant piece
        of furniture has a holistic structure." Winner of the 1969 Museum of Modern Art Award.<br>
        <div class="a">Construction notes: Base is constructed from molded cast aluminum polished and coated in tough, abrasion-resistant rilsan finish (black & white) 
        or a satin grey paint finish laminate top: offered in white or black is an exceptionally durable plastic surface. Highly 
        resistant, smooth satin surface, the finish resists fingerprints making it smooth, durable, and easy to maintain. 1.06" 
        bevel-edged satin smooth laminate.</div></div>

            <div class="container-02">Well first, let's back up a bit, to the 1940s at the prestigious Cranbrook Academy of Art, 
                the Michigan school that produced such design talents as Florence Knoll, Eero Saarinen, and Harry Bertoia. That's 
                where students Charles and Ray (then Ray-Bernice Alexandra Kaiser) Eames first met. Following their graduation, the 
                Eameses moved to Los Angeles, where they founded the Eames Office and began conducting experiments with cheap materials 
                like plastic and plywood, to create furniture that could be easily mass-produced.<br>
                <div class="a"></div> "When Ray and Charles Eames designed a piece of furniture, they always took a human-centered approach," notes Amy Auscherman, 
                Head of Archive and Brand Heritage at Herman Miller, which has produced the chair continuously since its debut. The Lounge 
                chair, however, was their take on luxuryâ€”a reinvention of the classic club chair with a modernist's use of technology and eye 
                for comfort. "The Eames Lounge and Ottoman was a continuation of the Eameses' experiments in molded plywood that took a more 
                luxurious approach. It was their first attempt at creating a luxury item that was intended as an heirloom," Auscherman says.</div>
