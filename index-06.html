        director Eliel Saarinen and textile artist Loja Saarinen, Eero Saarinen was surrounded by design his whole 
        life. It came as no surprise that Eero was helping his father design furniture and fixtures for the Cranbrook 
        campus by the time he was in his teens. In 1929 Eero left for Paris where he studied sculpture before enrolling 
        in the Yale architecture program the following year. In 1934, he returned to Michigan to teach at Cranbrook, work 
        on furniture designs, and practice architecture with his father.<br><a href="https://www.knoll.com/designer/Eero-Saarinen">READ MORE</a></p>

        and work began to intertwine. Their courtship lasted only a few months, sparked by Ray’s assistance in Charles and Eero Saarinen’s entry into MoMA’s 
        “Organic Design in Home Furnishings” design competition. Immediately following their marriage in June of 1941, Charles and Ray optimistically moved 
        to Los Angeles, bursting with exuberance for one another and their potential future in the arts and design.<br><a href="https://www.eamesoffice.com/about/biography/">READ MORE</a></p>

        and journalist, and one of the founders of American Modernism. Born in Hartford, CT, he received a BFA from Yale University, and later studied at the American 
        Academy in Rome. Between 1935 and 1949, he worked as an associate editor and then consultant editor for the journal Architectural Forum. During this time, Nelson 
        wrote in defense of Modernist principles, arguing that it was the designer’s job to improve the world by following the rules of nature.<br>

            of designs from the golden age. We want to design products of our age, how people live, work, think and feel today, with an emphasis on thinking outside 
            national borders and culture.” They moved in 2009 to the London design district of Clerkenwell, then in 2014 to Lisbon, where they now reside.<br><a href="https://www.dwr.com/designer-flemming-busk-and-stephan-hertzog?lang=en_US">READ MORE</a></p>

            late 1930s, Mies emigrated to the United States. There he created such well-known Modernist works as the Lake Shore Drive Apartments and the Seagram 
            Building. He died in 1969.<br><a href="https://www.biography.com/artist/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe">READ MORE</a></p>
